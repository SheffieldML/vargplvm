  abstract = {We propose a new class of learning algorithms that combines variational
	approximation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. Naive
	algorithms that use the variational approximation as proposal distribution
	can perform poorly because this approximation tends to underestimate
	the true variance and other features of the data. We solve this problem
	by introducing more sophisticated MCMC algorithms. One of these algorithms
	is a mixture of two MCMC kernels: a random walk Metropolis kernel
	and a block Metropolis-Hastings (MH) kernel with a variational approximation
	as proposal distribution. The MH kernel allows one to locate regions
	of high probability efficiently. The Metropolis kernel allows us
	to explore the vicinity of these regions. This algorithm outperforms
	variational approximations because it yields slightly better estimates
	of the mean and considerably better estimates of higher moments,
	such as covariances. It also outperforms standard MCMC algorithms
	because it locates the regions of high probability quickly, thus
	speeding up convergence. We demonstrate this algorithm on the problem
	of Bayesian parameter estimation for logistic (sigmoid) belief networks.},

	be used to infer posterior distributions over number of components

	for adding components it is possible to perform the variational optimisation
	incrementally and to avoid local maxima. Results show that the method
	works very well in practice and connectly infers the number and dimensionality

	in the spirit of a collocation method based on noisy evaluations

	Prior knowledge about the solution is encoded in terms of the covariance
	kernel of the GP. As in GP regression, analytical expressions for
	the mean and variance of the estimated target function are obtained
	from which the solution to the operator equation follows by a manipulation
	of the kernel. Linear initial and boundary value constraints can
	be enforced by embedding the non-parametric model in a form that
	automatically satisfies the boundary conditions. The method is illustrated
	on a noisy linear first-order ordinary differential equation with
	initial condition and on a noisy second-order partial differential

  abstract = {Feedforward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons are popular
	tools for nonlinear regression and classification problems. From
	a Bayesian perspective, a choice of a neural network model can be
	viewed as defining a prior probability distribution over non-linear
	functions, and the neural network's learning process can be interpreted
	in terms of the posterior probability distribution over the unknown
	function. (Some learning algorithms search for the function with
	maximum posterior probability and other Monte Carlo methods draw
	samples from this posterior probability). In the limit of large but
	otherwise standard networks, \cite{Neal:book96} has shown that the
	prior distribution over non-linear functions implied by the Bayesian
	neural network falls in a class of probability distributions known
	as Gaussian processes. The hyperparameters of the neural network
	model determine the characteristic lengthscales of the Gaussian process.
	Neal's observation motivates the idea of discarding parameterized
	networks and working directly with Gaussian processes. Computations
	in which the parameters of the network are optimized are then replaced
	by simple matrix operations using the covariance matrix of the Gaussian
	process. In this chapter I will review work on this idea by \cite{Williams:Gaussian96},
	\cite{Neal:montecarlogp97}, \cite{Barber:Gaussian97} and \cite{Gibbs:variational00},
	and will assess whether, for supervised regression and classification
	tasks, the feedforward network has been superceded.},

  abstract = {High dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold
	can be described by a collection of local linear models. Such a description,
	however, does not provide a global parameterization of the manifold

	paper, we show how to learn a collection of local linear models that
	solves this more difficult problem. Our local linear models are represented
	by a mixture of factor analyzers, and the "global coordination" of
	these models is achieved by adding a regularizing term to the standard

	from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled
	paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short
	English document and its French translation. This representation
	can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering
	task, both in a standard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using
	kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products,
	each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The
	correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel
	Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the
	first and in the second space that are maximally correlated. Since
	we assume the two representations are completely independent apart
	from the semantic content, any correlation between them should reflect
	some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that
	relate to a specific meaning should correlate with certain patterns
	of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus.
	Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we first demonstrate
	that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus
	are significantly higher than random, and hence that a representation
	based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should
	reflect semantic information. Then we use such representation both

  abstract = {We describe a learning-based method for recovering 3D human body pose
	from single images and monocular image sequences. Our approach requires
	neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in
	the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression
	against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image
	silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation
	errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts
	descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge
	regression, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression, and Support
	Vector Machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases.
	The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance,
	and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance.
	The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery
	of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the
	method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using
	dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned
	regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting
	system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization
	over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images
	resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is
	demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both
	quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively
	on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6 degrees are obtained
	for a variety of walking motions.},

	have been cloned. By combining the techniques of genetics, molecular
	biology and experimental embryology, it is becoming possible to unravel
	the role played by each of these genes. The repeating segment pattern
	is defined by the persistent expression of engrailed and of other
	genes of the 'segment polarity' class. The establishment of this
	pattern is directed by a transient molecular prepattern that is generated
	in the blastoderm by the activity of the 'pair-rule' genes. Maternal
	determinants at the poles of the egg coordinate this prepattern and
	define the anteroposterior sequence of pattern elements. The primary
	effect of these determinants is not known, but genes required for
	their production have been identified and the product of one of these,
	bicoid is known to be localized at the anterior of the egg. One early
	consequence of their activity is to define domains along the A-P
	axis within which a series of 'cardinal' genes are transcribed. The
	activity of the cardinal genes is required both to coordinate the
	process of segmentation and to define the early domains of homeotic

  pages = {1--24},
  abstract = {\emph{Objective}: Handling time-related concepts is essential in medicine.
	During diagnosis it can make a substantial difference to know the
	temporal order in which some symptoms occurred or for how long they
	lasted. During prognosis the potential evolutions of a disease are
	conceived as a description of events unfolding in time. In therapy
	planning the different steps of treatment must be applied in a precise
	order, with a given frequency and for a certain span of time in order
	to be effective. This article offers a survey on the use of temporal
	reasoning for decision supportrelated tasks in medicine.\\\\ \emph{Material
	and methods}: Key publications of the area, mainly circumscribed
	to the latest two decades, are reviewed and classified according
	to three important stages of patient treatment requiring decision
	support: diagnosis, prognosis and therapy planning/management. Other
	complementary publications, like those on time-centered information
	storage and retrieval, are also considered as they provide valuable
	support to the above mentioned three stages. Results: Key areas are
	highlighted and used to organize the latest contributions. The survey
	of previous research is followed by an analysis of what can still
	be improved and what is needed to make the next generation of decision
	support systems for medicine more effective.\\\\ \emph{Conclusions}:
	It can be observed that although the area has been considerably developed,
	there are still areas where more research is needed to make time-based
	systems of widespread use in decision support-related areas of medicine.
	Several suggestions for further exploration are proposed as a result
	of the survey.},

	permits the use of exact and efficient inference procedures based

	the contrastive divergence algorithm. We report the performance on

	Whether discussing the level of gene expression in a bacterium or
	its precise location within a developing embryo, the natural language
	for these experiments is that of numbers. Such quantitative data
	demands quantitative models. We review a class of models ("thermodynamic
	models") which exploit statistical mechanics to compute the probability
	that RNA polymerase is at the appropriate promoter. This provides
	a mathematically precise elaboration of the idea that activators
	are agents of recruitment which increase the probability that RNA
	polymerase will be found at the promoter of interest. We discuss
	a framework which describes the interactions of repressors, activators,
	helper molecules and RNA polymerase using the concept of effective
	concentrations, expressed in terms of a function we call the "regulation
	factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability
	of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function
	of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell. In a companion

	Catweasel is a novel N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutation.
	Heterozygous catweasel mutant mice exhibit mild headtossing associated
	with a posterior crista defect. We mapped the catweasel mutation
	to a critical region of 13 Mb on chromosome 12 containing the Six1,
	-4 and -6 genes. We identified a basepair substitution in exon 1
	of the Six1 gene that changes a conserved glutamic acid (E) at position
	121 to a glycine (G) in the Six1 homeodomain. Cwe/Cwe animals lack
	Preyer and righting reflexes, display severe headshaking and have
	severely truncated cochlea and semicircular canals. Cwe/Cwe animals
	had very few hair cells in the utricle, but their ampullae and cochlea
	were devoid of any hair cells. Bmp4, Jag1 and Sox2 expression were
	largely absent at early stages of sensory development and NeuroD
	expression was reduced in the developing vestibulo-acoustic ganglion.
	Lastly we show that Six1 genetically interacts with Jag1. We propose
	that the catweasel phenotype is due to a hypomorphic mutation in
	Six1 and that catweasel mice are a suitable model for branchio-oto-renal
	syndrome. In addition Six1 has a pivotal role in early sensory patch
	development and may act in the same genetic pathway as Jag1.},

	A mutant form of the catalytic subunit where Thr-197 was replaced
	with Asp was not a substrate for PDK1. In addition, phosphorylation
	of the catalytic subunit can be monitored immunochemically by using
	antibodies that recognize Thr-197 phosphorylated enzyme but not unphosphorylated
	enzyme or the Thr197Asp mutant. PDK1, or one of its homologs, is

  abstract = {Epigenetic control of gene transcription is critical for normal human
	development and cellular differentiation. While alterations of epigenetic
	marks such as DNA methylation have been linked to cancers and many
	other human diseases, interindividual epigenetic variations in normal
	tissues due to aging, environmental factors, or innate susceptibility
	are poorly characterized. The plasticity, tissue-specific nature,
	and variability of gene expression are related to epigenomic states
	that vary across individuals. Thus, population-based investigations
	are needed to further our understanding of the fundamental dynamics
	of normal individual epigenomes. We analyzed 217 non-pathologic human
	tissues from 10 anatomic sites at 1,413 autosomal CpG loci associated
	with 773 genes to investigate tissue-specific differences in DNA
	methylation and to discern how aging and exposures contribute to
	normal variation in methylation. Methylation profile classes derived
	from unsupervised modeling were significantly associated with age
	(P<0.0001) and were significant predictors of tissue origin (P<0.0001).
	In solid tissues (n = 119) we found striking, highly significant
	CpG island-dependent correlations between age and methylation; loci
	in CpG islands gained methylation with age, loci not in CpG islands
	lost methylation with age (P<0.001), and this pattern was consistent
	across tissues and in an analysis of blood-derived DNA. Our data
	clearly demonstrate age- and exposure-related differences in tissue-specific
	methylation and significant age-associated methylation patterns which
	are CpG island context-dependent. This work provides novel insight
	into the role of aging and the environment in susceptibility to diseases
	such as cancer and critically informs the field of epigenomics by
	providing evidence of epigenetic dysregulation by age-related methylation
	alterations. Collectively we reveal key issues to consider both in
	the construction of reference and disease-related epigenomes and
	in the interpretation of potentially pathologically important alterations.},

  abstract = {\bf{Background}\\ \\ Affymetrix microarrays have become increasingly
	popular in gene-expression studies; however, limitations of the technology
	have not been well established for commercially available arrays.
	The hybridization signal has been shown to be proportional to actual
	transcript concentration for specialized arrays containing hundreds
	of distinct probe pairs per gene. Additionally, the technology has
	been described as capable of distinguishing concentration levels
	within a factor of 2, and of detecting transcript frequencies as
	low as 1 in 2,000,000. Using commercially available arrays, we assessed
	these representations directly through a series of 'spike-in' hybridizations
	involving four prokaryotic transcripts in the absence and presence
	of fixed eukaryotic background. The contribution of probe-target
	interactions to the mismatch signal was quantified under various
	analyte concentrations.\\ \\ \bf{Results}\\ \\ A linear relationship
	between transcript abundance and signal was consistently observed
	between 1 pM and 10 pM transcripts. The signal ceased to be linear
	above the 10 pM level and commenced saturating around the 100 pM
	level. The 0.1 pM transcripts were virtually undetectable in the
	presence of eukaryotic background. Our measurements show that preponderance
	of the signal for mismatch probes derives from interactions with
	the target transcripts.\\ \\ \bf{Conclusions}\\ \\ Landmark studies
	outlining an observed linear relationship between signal and transcript
	concentration were carried out under highly specialized conditions
	and may not extend to commercially available arrays under routine
	operating conditions. Additionally, alternative metrics that are
	not based on the difference in the signal of members of a probe pair
	may further improve the quantitative utility of the Affymetrix GeneChip®

	therapy (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) were genotyped for
	38 pairwise-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning
	12 candidate genes from the p38 network. Regression analyses were

	able to measure the output of the gene regulatory network. We aim
	here to review datamining and modeling approaches for conceptualizing
	and unraveling the functional relationships implicit in these datasets.
	Clustering of co-expression profiles allows us to infer shared regulatory
	inputs and functional pathways. We discuss various aspects of clustering,
	ranging from distance measures to clustering algorithms and multiple-cluster
	memberships. More advanced analysis aims to infer causal connections
	between genes directly, i.e. who is regulating whom and how. We discuss
	several approaches to the problem of reverse engineering of genetic
	networks, from discrete Boolean networks, to continuous linear and
	non-linear models. We conclude that the combination of predictive
	modeling with systematic experimental verification will be required
	to gain a deeper insight into living organisms, therapeutic targeting

  abstract = {Genome-wide identification of bona-fide targets of transcription factors
	in mammalian cells is still a challenge. We present a novel integrated
	computational and experimental approach to identify direct targets
	of a transcription factor. This consists of measuring time-course
	(dynamic) gene expression profiles upon perturbation of the transcription
	factor under study, and in applying a novel "reverse-engineering"
	algorithm (TSNI) to rank genes according to their probability of
	being direct targets. Using primary keratinocytes as a model system,
	we identified novel transcriptional target genes of TRP63, a crucial
	regulator of skin development. TSNI-predicted TRP63 target genes
	were validated by Trp63 knockdown and by ChIP-chip to identify TRP63-bound
	regions in vivo. Our study revealed that short sampling times, in
	the order of minutes, are needed to capture the dynamics of gene
	expression in mammalian cells. We show that TRP63 transiently regulates
	a subset of its direct targets, thus highlighting the importance
	of considering temporal dynamics when identifying transcriptional
	targets. Using this approach, we uncovered a previously unsuspected
	transient regulation of the AP-1 complex by TRP63 through direct
	regulation of a subset of AP-1 components. The integrated experimental
	and computational approach described here is readily applicable to
	other transcription factors in mammalian systems and is complementary
	to genome-wide identification of transcription-factor binding sites.},

  abstract = {Common human diseases result from the interplay of many genes and
	environmental factors. Therefore, a more integrative biology approach
	is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases.
	To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity,
	we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population-based
	blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various
	phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast
	to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation
	between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity-related traits.
	Genome-wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant
	genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic
	effect of proximal (cis) signals, with 50\% of the cis signals overlapping
	between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive
	transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that
	exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed
	from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice
	was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory
	and immune response and has been found to be causally associated
	to obesity-related traits.},

	study but did not remain statistically significant at the corrected
	threshold.In exploring the overlap between T1D, CeD and RA, there
	is strong evidence that variation within the TAGAP gene is associated
	with all three autoimmune diseases. Interestingly a number of loci
	appear to be specific to one of the three diseases currently studied

	often lethal infectious diseases induced by novel pathogens. Since
	the ability to mount primary immune responses relies on the availability
	of naive T cells, the circulating naive T-cell reservoir was evaluated
	throughout the human life span. Naive T cells were identified as
	CD95(-) T lymphocytes for their phenotypic and functional features.
	Indeed, the lack of CD95 marker is sufficient to identify a population
	of naive T cells, as defined by coincidence with previously characterized
	CD45RA(+) CD62L(+) T cells. Naive CD95(-) T cells, as expected, require
	a costimulatory signal, such as CD28, to optimally proliferate after
	anti-CD3 stimulation. Cytofluorimetric analysis of circulating T
	lymphocytes from 120 healthy subjects ranging in age from 18 to 105
	years revealed that naive T cells decreased sharply with age. The
	younger subjects had a naive T-lymphocyte count of 825 +/- 48 cells/microL,
	and the centenarians had a naive T-lymphocyte count of 177 +/- 28
	cells/microL. Surprisingly, the naive T-cell count was lower in CD8(+)
	than in CD4(+) subsets at any age, and the oldest individuals were
	almost completely depleted of circulating naive CD8(+) T cells (13
	+/- 4 cells/microL). Concomitantly, a progressive expansion of CD28(-)
	T cells occurs with age, which can be interpreted as a compensatory
	mechanism. These data provide new insights into age-related T-cell-mediated
	immunodeficiency and reveal some analogies of T-cell dynamics between
	advanced aging and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
	In conclusion, the exhaustion of the naive CD8(+) T-cell reservoir,
	which has never been reported before, suggests that this T-cell pool
	is a major target of the aging process and may define a parameter
	possibly related to the life span of humans. (Blood. 2000;95:2860-2868)},

  abstract = {\bf{Motivation:} Diffusable and non-diffusable gene products play
	a major role in body plan formation. A quantitative understanding
	of the spatio-temporal patterns formed in body plan formation, by
	using simulation models is an important addition to experimental
	observation. The inverse modelling approach consists of describing
	the body plan formation by a rule-based model, and fitting the model
	parameters to real observed data. In body plan formation, the data
	are usually obtained from fluorescent immunohistochemistry or in
	situ hybridizations. Inferring model parameters by comparing such
	data to those from simulation is a major computational bottleneck.
	An important aspect in this process is the choice of method used
	for parameter estimation. When no information on parameters is available,
	parameter estimation is mostly done by means of heuristic algorithms.\\\\
	\bf{Results:} We show that parameter estimation for pattern formation
	models can be efficiently performed using an evolution strategy (ES).
	As a case study we use a quantitative spatio-temporal model of the
	regulatory network for early development in Drosophila melanogaster.
	In order to estimate the parameters, the simulated results are compared
	to a time series of gene products involved in the network obtained
	with immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that a (µ,{lambda})-ES
	can be used to find good quality solutions in the parameter estimation.
	We also show that an ES with multiple populations is 5–140 times
	as fast as parallel simulated annealing for this case study, and
	that combining ES with a local search results in an efficient parameter
	estimation method.\\\\ Supplementary information and availability:

  abstract = {It has been shown that the functions and the rescue from apoptosis
	by proinflammatory mediators of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)
	tend to diminish with aging. Here, we investigated the role of protein
	tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), especially Src homology domain-containing
	protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), in the age-related, altered
	PMN functions under granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor
	(GM-CSF) stimulation. The inhibition of PTP suggested a differential
	effect of GM-CSF on phosphatase activity in modulating PMN functions
	with aging. The down-regulation of phosphatase activity of immunopurified
	SHP-1 from lipid rafts of PMN of young donors was found significantly
	altered at 1 min of stimulation with aging. In young donors, SHP-1
	is displaced from lipid rafts at 1 min of stimulation, whereas in
	the elderly, SHP-1 is constantly present. We assessed in PMN lipid
	rafts the phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine residues of SHP-1,
	which regulates its activity. We observed an alteration in the phosphorylation
	of tyrosine and serine residues of SHP-1 in PMN of elderly subjects,
	suggesting that GM-CSF was unable to inhibit SHP-1 activity by serine
	phosphorylation. GM-CSF activates Lyn rapidly, and we found alterations
	in its activation and translocation to the lipid rafts with aging.
	We also demonstrate that SHP-1 in the PMN of elderly is constantly
	recruited to Lyn, which cannot be relieved by GM-CSF. In contrast,
	in the young, the resting recruitment could be relieved by GM-CSF.
	Our results suggest an alteration of the SHP-1 modulation by GM-CSF
	in lipid rafts of PMN with aging. These alterations could contribute
	to the decreased GM-CSF effects on PMN.},

	overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA

  abstract = {DNA hybridization arrays simultaneously measure the expression level
	for thousands of genes. These measurements provide a "snapshot" of
	transcription levels within the cell. A major challenge in computational
	biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions

	propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes
	based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds
	on the use of \emph{Bayesian networks} for representing statistical
	dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint
	multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of
	conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive
	for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because
	they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations.
	We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions
	between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions
	from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks.
	Finally, we demonstrate this method on the \emph{S. cerevisiae} cell-cycle
	measurements of \cite{Spellman:yeastcellcy98}.},

  abstract = {The molecular basis of mechanosensation, mechanosensory cell development
	and mechanosensory organ development is reviewed with an emphasis
	on its evolution. In contrast to eye evolution and development, which
	apparently modified a genetic program through intercalation of genes
	between the master control genes on the top (Pax6, Eya1, Six1) of
	the hierarchy and the structural genes (rhodopsin) at the bottom,
	the as yet molecularly unknown mechanosensory channel precludes such
	a firm conclusion for mechanosensors. However, recent years have
	seen the identification of several structural genes which are involved
	in mechanosensory tethering and several transcription factors controlling
	mechanosensory cell and organ development; these warrant the interpretation
	of available data in very much the same fashion as for eye evolution:
	molecular homology combined with potential morphological parallelism.
	This assertion of molecular homology is strongly supported by recent
	findings of a highly conserved set of microRNAs that appear to be
	associated with mechanosensory cell development across phyla. The
	conservation of transcription factors and their regulators fits very
	well to the known or presumed mechanosensory specializations which
	can be mostly grouped as variations of a common cellular theme. Given
	the widespread distribution of the molecular ability to form mechanosensory
	cells, it comes as no surprise that structurally different mechanosensory
	organs evolved in different phyla, presenting a variation of a common
	theme specified by a conserved set of transcription factors in their
	cellular development. Within vertebrates and arthropods, some mechanosensory
	organs evolved into auditory organs, greatly increasing sensitivity
	to sound through modifications of accessory structures to direct
	sound to the specific sensory epithelia. However, while great attention
	has been paid to the evolution of these accessory structures in vertebrate
	fossils, comparatively less attention has been spent on the evolution
	of the inner ear and the central auditory system. Recent advances
	in our molecular understanding of ear and brain development provide
	novel avenues to this neglected aspect of auditory neurosensory evolution.},

  abstract = {{\bf Background}\\\\ Functional genomics studies are yielding information
	about regulatory processes in the cell at an unprecedented scale.
	In the yeast S. cerevisiae, DNA microarrays have not only been used
	to measure the mRNA abundance for all genes under a variety of conditions
	but also to determine the occupancy of all promoter regions by a
	large number of transcription factors. The challenge is to extract
	useful information about the global regulatory network from these
	data.\\\\ {\bf Results}\\\\ We present MA-Networker, an algorithm
	that combines microarray data for mRNA expression and transcription
	factor occupancy to define the regulatory network of the cell. Multivariate
	regression analysis is used to infer the activity of each transcription
	factor, and the correlation across different conditions between this
	activity and the mRNA expression of a gene is interpreted as regulatory
	coupling strength. Applying our method to S. cerevisiae, we find
	that, on average, 58\% of the genes whose promoter region is bound
	by a transcription factor are true regulatory targets. These results
	are validated by an analysis of enrichment for functional annotation,
	response for transcription factor deletion, and over-representation
	of cis-regulatory motifs. We are able to assign directionality to
	transcription factors that control divergently transcribed genes
	sharing the same promoter region. Finally, we identify an intrinsic
	limitation of transcription factor deletion experiments related to
	the combinatorial nature of transcriptional control, to which our
	approach provides an alternative.\\\\ {\bf Conclusion}\\\\ Our reliable
	classification of ChIP positives into functional and non-functional
	TF targets based on their expression pattern across a wide range
	of conditions provides a starting point for identifying the unknown
	sequence features in non-coding DNA that directly or indirectly determine
	the context dependence of transcription factor action. Complete analysis

	that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer
	physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately
	the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable.
	There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within
	the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal
	with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital
	computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure
	to \emph{numerically simulate} the time evolution of the given chemical
	system. Like the master equation, this ``stochastic simulation algorithm''
	correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations
	that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In
	addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic
	reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal
	time increments $\mathrm{d}t$ by finite time steps $\Delta t$. The
	feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated

	the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

  abstract = {The p53 tumor suppressor has been termed ``the Guardian of the Cell.''
	It is not essential for life—mice that are deficient in this protein
	are born seemingly normal—but it is essential in its role of protecting
	an organism from rogue cells. p53 guards two gates: a gate to life
	and a gate to death. Sensing damage to DNA, p53 can initiate two
	processes to isolate the damaged cell and prevent its uncontrolled
	growth. It can halt cell division, freezing the cell at the G1 checkpoint
	of the cellular cycle. The cell is unable to reproduce, and its damaged
	genome is safely isolated. p53 can also initiate a more permanent
	solution: programmed cell death, or apoptosis. p53 tumor suppressor
	acts as transcriptional activator, controlling the expression of
	a variety of genes important in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
	p53, composed of four identical subunits, binds to a specific site
	on the DNA, and interacts with transcription interaction factors,
	leading to the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.
	p53 itself is present at extremely low levels in most cells, and
	has a life span of mere minutes. These low levels allow the action
	of p53 to be genetically controlled. Levels may be raised quickly
	by synthesis of more p53, and high levels are quickly reduced when
	synthesis abates. The induction of p53 has a hair-trigger: even a
	single double-stranded break of the DNA has been predicted to be
	enough. As one might expect, disruption of a process with such an
	important function will have dire consequences. Approximately half
	of all cases of human cancer may be attributed to a defective p53
	protein. Most of these are caused by missense mutations in the p53
	gene, changing one amino acid in the protein to another. This may
	alter the binding of the protein to DNA or to the transcription factors,
	corrupting the signal from p53 to the cellular machinery, or it may
	unnaturally increase the stability of the protein, corrupting the
	delicate balance of synthesis and degradation that controls the level
	of p53 in the cell. Either way, p53 is unable to open the gates to
	cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and cancerous cells are allowed to
	proliferate without control.}

	1 (NFkBIL1) gene located in the class III region of the major histocompatibility
	complex (MHC) as a possible susceptibility locus for rheumatoid arthritis
	(RA). Based on limited homology, it has been suggested to be a member
	of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) family of proteins, but a
	role in mRNA processing has also been proposed. We have investigated
	the expression of NFkBIL1 in RA synovial tissue and characterized
	its function. Real-time PCR showed the two NFkBIL1 mRNA splice variants
	are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Dual immunofluorescent
	staining of human RA synovium with polyclonal anti-NFkBIL1 antibodies
	and anti-CD68, anti-CD3 or anti-factor VIII showed that NFkBIL1 was
	expressed in the rheumatoid synovial lining and sub-lining layers
	and co-localized in CD68+ and CD3+, but not Factor VIII+ cells. Confocal
	microscopy of cultured synovial fibroblasts revealed expression in
	speckled nuclear and homogenous cytoplasmic distributions, suggesting
	shuttling between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Functional
	tests showed that NFkBIL1 isoforms were incapable of associating
	with NF-kappaB and did not inhibit it, thus disproving the hypothesis
	that NFkBIL1 functions as an IkappaB. Affinity purification of endogenous
	NFkBIL1 proteins and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that
	NFkBIL1 can associate with mRNA and with three protein partners,
	identified by mass spectrometry as leukophysin, translation elongation
	factor 1 alpha and CTP synthase I. These data support a potential
	role for NFkBL1 in the pathogenesis of RA and indicates that it may
	be involved in mRNA processing or the regulation of translation.},

	to phosphorylation. We apply this method to a test set comprised

	conformational changes, with near-atomic accuracy in most cases.
	Examples of proteins used for testing our methods include kinases

	methods can be used to provide new understanding of how phosphorylation
	drives conformational change, why substituting Glu or Asp for a phosphorylated
	amino acid does not always mimic the effects of phosphorylation,
	and how a phosphatase can “capture” a phosphorylated amino acid.

  note = {Submitted},
  abstract = {Quantitative computational models can play important roles in modern
	biology as compact, predictive descriptions of complex systems. Such
	models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their
	values is often a substantial obstacle to model development and use.
	Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and
	several researchers have found that collectively fitting parameters
	to other experimental data yields large parameter uncertainties.
	Nevertheless, Brown et al. showed in a growth-factor-signaling model
	that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions
	even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained.
	They also showed that their model had a 'sloppy' spectrum of parameter
	sensitivities: roughly linearly spaced in the logarithm over a huge
	range. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to
	demonstrate the apparent universality of such sloppy spectra in systems
	biology. This sloppiness has several consequences for building predictive
	models. We predict and verify that collective fits to even large
	amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters
	poorly constrained. This may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements,
	but we demonstrate using a particular model that such measurements
	must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain model
	predictions. The prevalence of sloppiness in complex biology suggests
	that collective fits are powerful and that modelers should focus
	on their desired predictions rather than on their parameters.},

	of signal transduction pathways that are involved in regulating cellular
	proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Although present in
	normal cells, EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell lines
	and has been associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival.
	EGFR activation also plays a role in resistance to chemotherapy and
	radiation treatment in tumor cells. Over the past two decades, much
	effort has been directed at developing anticancer agents that can
	interfere with EGFR activity. The most common pharmacologic approaches
	to inhibiting EGFR have been to develop monoclonal antibodies and
	small-molecule inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies block ligand binding
	to the extra- cellular domain, whereas the small-molecule inhibitors
	exert their effects at the intracellular portion of the receptor
	to prevent tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and subsequent activation

	Maps still often creates unnecessary distortions, and its performance
	varies widely in response to parameter value changes. In this paper,
	we draw a previously unnoticed connection between DiffMaps and spring-motivated
	methods. We show that DiffMaps has a physical interpretation: it
	finds the arrangement of high-dimensional objects in low-dimensional
	space that minimizes the elastic energy of a particular spring network.
	Within this interpretation, we recognize the root cause of a variety
	of problems that are commonly observed in the Diffusion Maps output,
	including sensitivity to user-specified parameters, sensitivity to
	sampling density, and distortion of boundaries. We then show how
	to exploit the connection between Diffusion Map and spring criteria
	to create a method that can be efficiently applied post hoc to alleviate
	these commonly observed deficiencies in the Diffusion Maps output.}

	cases (who possibly had an infection with wheezing at 3–4 years of
	age), day-care attendance and a short duration of breastfeeding resulted
	in increased risk. The results support the hypothesis that opportunity

	Now we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use

	for posterior development [1,9–11]. Mutations in these maternal posterior-group
	genes result in embryos lacking all abdominal segments. Cytoplasmic
	transplantation studies indicate that the maternally encoded product
	of the \emph{nanos (nos)} gene may act as an abdominal determinant,
	whereas the other maternal posterior-group genes appear to be required
	for the appropriate localization and stabilization of this signal1,
	[9–12]. Here we show that the lack of the \emph{nos} gene product
	can be compensated for by eliminating the maternal activity of the
	gap gene \emph{hunchback (hb)}. Embryos lacking both of these maternally
	derived gene products are viable and can survive as fertile adults.
	These results suggest that the \emph{nos} gene product functions
	by repressing the activity of the maternal \emph{hb} products in
	the posterior of the egg.},

	array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip® system with the objective
	of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our
	analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study
	consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip® arrays, part of the data
	from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's
	Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip® arrays; and
	part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A
	GeneChip® arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect
	match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine
	the variance?mean relationship with probe-level data from probes
	believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain
	why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level
	intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using
	spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's
	(i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii)
	the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI).
	The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a
	new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of
	background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We
	evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution
	study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and
	(for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms
	in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential
	expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no
	obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE)
	to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific
	affinities.},

	morphogen gradients in the early \emph{Drosophila} embryo. However,
	it remains unclear whether these gradients are indeed sufficient
	to establish the boundaries of localized gap gene expression patterns.
	In this study, we address this question using gap gene circuits,
	which are data-driven mathematical tools for extracting regulatory
	information from quantitative wild-type gene expression data. We
	present new, quantitative data on the mRNA expression patterns for
	the gap genes \emph{Kr\"uppel} (\emph{Kr}), \emph{knirps} (\emph{kni})

	\emph{Drosophila} development. This data set shows significant differences
	in timing of gap gene expression compared to previous observations,
	and reveals that early gap gene expression is highly variable in
	both space and time. Gene circuit models fit to this data set were
	used for a detailed regulatory analysis of early gap gene expression.
	Our analysis shows that the proper balance of maternal repression
	and activation is essential for the correct positioning of gap domains,
	and that such balance can only be achieved for early expression of
	kni. In contrast, our results suggest that early expression of gt
	requires local neutralization of repressive input in the anterior
	region of the embryo, and that known maternal gradients are completely
	insufficient to position the boundaries of the early central Kr domain,
	or in fact any Kr-like domain in the central region of the blastoderm

  abstract = {Mixture of Experts(ME) is an ensemble of function approximators that
	fit the clustered data set locally rather than globally. ME provides
	a useful tool to learn multi-valued mappings(ambiguities) in the
	data set. Mixture of Experts training involve learning a multi-category
	classifier for the gates distribution and fitting a regressor within
	each of the clusters. The learning of ME is based on divide and conquer
	which is known to increase the error due to variance. In order to
	avoid overfitting several researchers have proposed using linear
	experts. However in the absence of any knowledge of non-linearities
	existing in the data set, it is not clear how many linear experts
	could accurately model the data.
	
	 In this work we propose a bayesian learning framework for learning
	Mixture of Experts. Bayesian learning intrinsically embodies regularization
	and model selection using Occam's razor. In the past Bayesian learning
	methods have been applied to classification and regression in order
	to avoid scale sensitivity and orthodox model selection procedure
	of cross validation. Although true Bayesian learning is computationally
	intractable, approximations do result in sparser and more compact
	models.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed
	a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific
	theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor,
	which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior
	probability on the null is one-half Although there has been much
	discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism
	of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as
	a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review
	and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific
	applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology.\\\\
	
	 We emphasize the following points:\\\\
	
	 * From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing
	is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory.\\\\
	
	
	 * Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a
	null hypothesis. * Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external
	information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis.\\\\
	
	 * Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models
	to be nested. \\\\
	
	 * Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including
	asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output
	from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. \\\\
	
	 * In "nonstandard" statistical models that do not satisfy common
	regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate
	Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. \\\\
	
	 * The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the
	logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not
	require evaluation of prior distributions.\\\\
	
	 * When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors
	may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that
	a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account
	of structural or model uncertainty.\\\\
	
	 * Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be
	taken into account when the class of models initially considered
	is very large.\\\\
	
	 * Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building
	process.\\\\
	
	 * It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions
	to the prior distributions used.},

	Our results demonstrate that senescence, FasL, and IL-10 are key

  abstract = {The basic underlying problem in reverse engineering of gene regulatory
	networks from gene expression data is that the expression of a gene
	encoding the regulator provides only limited information about its
	protein activity. The proteins, which result from translation, are
	subject to stringent posttranscriptional control and modification.
	Often, it is only the modified version of the protein that is capable
	of activating or repressing its regulatory targets. At present there
	exists no reliable high-throughput technology to measure the protein
	activity levels in real-time, and therefore they are, so-to-say,
	lost in translation. However, these activity levels can be recovered
	by studying the gene expression of their targets. Here, we describe
	a computational approach to predict temporal regulator activity levels
	from the gene expression of its transcriptional targets in a network
	motif with one regulator and many targets. We consider an example
	of an SOS repair system, and computationally infer the regulator
	activity of its master repressor, LexA. The reconstructed activity
	profile of LexA exhibits a behavior that is similar to the experimentally
	measured profile of this repressor: after UV irradiation, the amount
	of LexA substantially decreases within a few minutes, followed by
	a recovery to its normal level. Our approach can easily be applied
	to known single-input motifs in other organisms.},

	has recently been shown to contribute to euchromatin gene silencing.
	To identify genes silenced by K9 modifications, we probed a human
	CpG island microarray with DNA obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation
	(ChIP) in a cancer cell line using an anti-H3-K9 methylated antibody
	or an anti-H3-K9 acetylated antibody. Of the 27 clones with the highest
	signal ratio of K9 methylation over acetylation (Me/Ac), 13 contained
	repetitive sequences. Among 14 nonrepetitive clones, we identified
	11 genes (seven known and four previously undescribed), one EST,
	and two unknown fragments. Using ChIP-PCR, all 18 examined clones
	showed higher ratios of H3-K9 Me/Ac than the active gene control,
	P21, thus confirming the microarray data. In addition, we found a
	strong correlation between the K9 Me/Ac ratio and CpG island DNA
	methylation (R = 0.92, P < 0.01), and five of seven genes examined
	(megalin, thrombospondin-4, KR18, latrophilin-3, and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
	kinase P101 subunit) showed lack of expression by RT-PCR and reactivation
	by DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylase inhibition, suggesting
	that these genes are true targets of silencing through histone modifications.
	All five genes also showed significant DNA methylation in a cell
	line panel and in primary colon cancers. Our data suggest that CpG
	island microarray coupled with ChIP can identify novel targets of
	gene silencing in cancer. This unbiased approach confirms the tight
	coupling between DNA methylation and histone modifications in cancer
	and could be used to probe gene silencing in nonneoplastic conditions

	concerned with describing linear dependencies between sets of variables.
	After a short exposition of the linear sample CCA problem and its

	relations between canonical vectors and variates. The article then
	addresses the problem of CCA between spaces spanned by objects mapped

	correlation (KCCA) problem is derived from a geometric point of view.
	It shows that the expansion coefficients of the canonical vectors
	in their respective feature space can be found by linear CCA in the
	basis induced by kernel principal component analysis. The effect
	of mappings into higher dimensional feature spaces is considered
	critically since it simplifies the CCA problem in general. Then two
	regularized variants of KCCA are discussed. Relations to other methods

	kernel principal component regression and possible applications thereof

	of a human body, from either 2D or 3D data. While such models can
	effectively represent the kinematic constraints of the skeletal structure,
	they do not capture additional constraints such as coordination of
	the limbs. Tree structured models thus miss an important source of
	information about human body pose, as limb coordination is necessary
	for balance while standing, walking, or running, as well as being
	evident in other activities such as dancing and throwing. In this
	paper, we consider the use of undirected graphical models that augment
	a tree structure with latent variables in order to account for coordination
	between limbs. We refer to these as common-factor models, since they
	are constructed by using factor analysis to identify additional correlations
	in limb position that are not accounted for by the kinematic tree
	structure. These common-factor models have an underlying tree structure
	and thus a variant of the standard Viterbi algorithm for a tree can
	be applied for efficient estimation. We present some experimental
	results contrasting common-factor models with tree models, and quantify
	the improvement in pose estimation for 2D image data.},

  abstract = {The process of maintaining life for the individual is a constant struggle
	to preserve his/her integrity. This can come at a price when immunity
	is involved, namely systemic inflammation. Inflammation is not per
	se a negative phenomenon: it is the response of the immune system
	to the invasion of viruses or bacteria and other pathogens. During
	evolution the human organism was set to live 40 or 50 years; today,
	however, the immune system must remain active for much a longer time.
	This very long activity leads to a chronic inflammation that slowly
	but inexorably damages one or several organs: this is a typical phenomenon
	linked to ageing and it is considered the major risk factor for age-related
	chronic diseases. Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes
	and even sarcopenia and cancer, just to mention a few - have an important
	inflammatory component, though disease progression seems also dependent
	on the genetic background of individuals. Emerging evidence suggests
	that pro-inflammatory genotypes are related to unsuccessful ageing,
	and, reciprocally, controlling inflammatory status may allow a better
	chance of successful ageing. In other words, age-related diseases
	are "the price we pay" for a life-long active immune system: this
	system has also the potential to harm us later, as its fine tuning
	becomes compromised. Our immune system has evolved to control pathogens,
	so pro-inflammatory responses are likely to be evolutionarily programmed
	to resist fatal infections with pathogens aggressively. Thus, inflammatory
	genotypes are an important and necessary part of the normal host
	responses to pathogens in early life, but the overproduction of inflammatory
	molecules might also cause immune-related inflammatory diseases and
	eventually death later. Therefore, low responder genotypes involved
	in regulation of innate defence mechanisms, might better control
	inflammatory responses and age-related disease development, resulting
	in an increased chance of long life survival in a "permissive" environment
	with reduced pathogen load, medical care and increased quality of
	life.},

	set of genes expressed within skin that are associated specifically
	with the hair-growth cycle. The methodology takes advantage of higher
	replicate variance during asynchronous hair cycles in comparison
	with synchronous cycles. More than one-third of genes with detectable

	suggesting that many more genes may be associated with the hair-growth

	clustering algorithm for replicated measurements, these genes were
	grouped into 30 time-course profile clusters, which fall into four
	major classes. Distinct genetic pathways were characteristic for
	the different time-course profile clusters, providing insights into
	the regulation of hair-follicle cycling and suggesting that this
	approach is useful for identifying hair follicle regulators. In addition
	to revealing known hair-related genes, we identified genes that were
	not previously known to be hair cycle-associated and confirmed their
	temporal and spatial expression patterns during the hair-growth cycle

  abstract = {Affymetrix microarrays are currently the most widely used 
	
	 microarray technology. Due to the complexity of microarray experiments,
	the experimental data is very noisy. Many summarization methods have
	been developed to provide gene expression levels from Affymetrix
	probe-level data. Most of the currently popular methods do not provide
	a measure of uncertainty for the estimated ex- pression level of
	each gene. The use of probabilistic models can overcome this limitation.
	This thesis extends a previously developed probabilistic model, mg-
	MOS, to obtain an improved model, multi-mgMOS. This new model provides
	improved accuracy and is more computationally e±cient than other
	alternatives. It also provides a level of uncertainty associated
	with the measured gene expres- sion level. This probe-level measurement
	error provides useful information to help in the downstream analysis
	of gene expression data.\\\\
	
	 In order to show the advantage of the probe-level probabilistic model,
	the obtained uncertainty is propagated in two downstream analyses
	of gene expression data. One is detecting differential gene expression,
	another is clustering. A Bayesian hierarchical model is proposed
	to include probe-level measurement error into the detection of differential
	gene expression from replicated experiments and a standard model-based
	clustering method is augmented to incorporate probe-level measurement
	error. Due to the inclusion of the probe-level measurement error,
	the downstream probabilistic models become more complicated or intractable.
	In order to perform inference with these augmented models efficiently,
	various inference approximation approaches are compared in this thesis,
	including Maximum a Posteriori, Laplace approximation, a variational
	method and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Results from both benchmark
	data sets and a real-world data set demonstrate that the incorporation
	of the probe-level measurement error improves the performance of
	the downstream probabilistic analysis.},

	 Clustering is an important analysis performed on microarray gene
	expression data since it groups genes which have similar expression
	patterns and enables the exploration of unknown gene functions. Microarray
	experiments are associated with many sources of experimental and
	biological variation and the resulting gene expression data are therefore
	very noisy. Many heuristic and model-based clustering approaches
	have been developed to cluster this noisy data. However, few of them
	include consideration of probe-level measurement error which provides
	rich information about technical variability.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Results}\\\\
	
	 We augment a standard model-based clustering method to incorporate
	probe-level measurement error. Using probe-level measurements from
	a recently developed Affymetrix probe-level model, multi-mgMOS, we
	include the probe-level measurement error directly into the standard
	Gaussian mixture model. Our augmented model is shown to provide improved
	clustering performance on simulated datasets and a real mouse time-course
	dataset.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Conclusion}\\\\
	
	 The performance of model-based clustering of gene expression data
	is improved by including probe-level measurement error and more biologically
	meaningful clustering results are obtained.},

	addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
	distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly
	matched with high probability against a large database of features
	from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
	these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
	matching individual features to a database of features from known
	objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
	transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
	finally performing verification through least-squares solution for
	consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly
	identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near
	real-time performance.},

	controls were studied using logistic regression, with secondary stratification
	by anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies(ACPA) and rheumatoid factor(RF).
	Susceptibility models were based on previously defined HLA-DRB1 shared

	models were compared, adjusting for HLA-DRB1 SE. A hierarchy of risk

	a risk similar to (*)0401 homozygosity (P=0.70). Protective effects

	HLA-DRB1 SE alleles were also associated with ACPA-negative, RF-positive

	diagonally dominant, attractive, non-frustrated, and pairwise-normalizable.
	We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation

  abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that
	carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the
	responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles:
	they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network
	motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is
	the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed
	of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other,
	both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible
	structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL
	can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the
	functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the
	FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators:
	they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following
	stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the
	other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs,
	act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear
	in transcription network databases much more frequently than others.
	In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding
	to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain
	why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse
	generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the
	function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements
	in transcription networks.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence has highlighted a major genetic contribution to radiographic
	damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study
	was to determine whether genetic variants in the loci for interleukin-1
	(IL-1), IL-6, IL-10, protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22), and
	selenoprotein S are associated with radiographic damage.Modified
	Larsen scores of radiographic damage were determined in a cross-sectional
	population of patients with RA (n = 964). Rheumatoid factor (RF)
	and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) were also assayed.
	The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used to compare median
	radiographic damage scores across genotype groups, followed by the
	Cuzick nonparametric test for trend to assess gene-dose effects.An
	allele-dose association of IL-6 -174G with increasing radiographic
	damage was present (P = 0.005), but only in patients who were RF
	positive (P = 0.004) or anti-CCP positive (P = 0.01). Patients with
	the IL-10 -592CC genotype had more extensive radiographic damage
	than did those with the AC or AA genotype (P = 0.006), but this was
	observed only among patients who were RF negative (P = 0.002) or
	anti-CCP negative (P = 0.002). However, RF status and anti-CCP status
	were not associated with the IL-6 or IL-10 genotype. No other genetic
	associations were detected, apart from a marginal association of
	PTPN22 +1858T with increased radiographic damage.The reported associations
	of IL-6 -174G with high IL-6 production and IL-10 -592 with low IL-10
	production and our own results support a role of genetically determined
	dysregulated cytokine production in disease severity. The lack of
	association of these genotypes with RF and anti-CCP antibody status
	suggests that they act downstream of autoantibody production. We
	conclude that IL-6 and IL-10 genotypes may be useful in predicting
	disease severity in autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative
	patients, respectively.},

	samples from healthy controls were measured using an ELISA and compared
	across the genotype groups.The allele frequency of the C allele (alanine)
	was lower in cases than in controls (38.4\% vs 41.7\%, p=0.04, OR
	0.9, 95\% CI 0.8 to 1.0), as were the CC/AC genotypes compared with

	shown that insertion of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PAI-2
	mRNA into the 3'-UTR of a beta-globin reporter mRNA reduces constitutive
	beta-globin mRNA expression and that this requires, at least in part,
	an AU-rich motif. Here we have directly assessed the role of this
	motif in PAI-2 mRNA stability using both chimeric and non- chimeric
	reporter systems. We first show that the full-length PAI-2 mRNA is
	indeed unstable with a half-life of 1 h. Using the c-fos promoter-driven
	human growth hormone (HGH) mRNA as a reporter, we demonstrate that
	the 580 nt 3'-UTR of PAI-2 accelerates chimeric HGH mRNA decay in
	a process which is dependent on the intact AU-rich sequence. Furthermore,
	disruption of this motif within a constitutively expressed PAI-2
	cDNA produces a 2.5- and 2. 7-fold increase in PAI-2 mRNA and protein
	levels in HT-1080 cells, respectively. RNA electrophoretic mobility
	shift and supershift assays indicate that this motif provides a specific
	binding site for cellular proteins that include nuclear HuR. Taken
	together, these data show that a correlation exists between the binding
	of HuR to the AU-rich motif in vitro and the destabilizing properties
	conferred by this sequence in vivo. },

	whether genotypes of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in the

	a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized
	probabilities of test images under the 10 different class specific
	models. To improve discriminative performance, a hierarchy of separate
	models can be learned for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy

	Our purpose is to provide a systematic method for discovering and

	a connectionist or "neural net" dynamics for biochemical regulators,
	coupled to "grammatical rules" which describe certain features of
	the birth, growth, and death of cells, synapses and other biological
	entities. We outline how spatial geometry can be included, although
	this part of the model is not complete. As an example of the application
	of our results to a specific biological system, we show in detail
	how to derive a rigorously testable model of the network of segmentation
	genes operating in the blastoderm of \emph{Drosophila}. To further
	illustrate our methods, we sketch how they could be applied to two
	other important developmental processes: cell cycle control and cell-cell
	induction. We also present a simple biochemical model leading to
	our assumed connectionist dynamics which shows that the dynamics

	by confirming that sgs1 and rmi1 mutants display the same spectrum

	of sgs1 or top3 strains including slow growth, hyperrecombination,
	DNA damage sensitivity, and reduced sporulation. And like top3 strains,
	most rmi1 phenotypes are suppressed by mutations in SGS1. We show
	that Rmi1 forms a heteromeric complex with Sgs1-Top3 in yeast and
	that these proteins interact directly in a recombinant system. The
	Rmi1-Top3 complex is stable in the absence of the Sgs1 helicase,
	but the loss of either Rmi1 or Top3 in yeast compromises its partner's
	interaction with Sgs1. Biochemical studies demonstrate that recombinant

  title = {Probabilistic Modeling of Gene Regulatory Networks from Data},
  school = {Hebrew University},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {The living cell consists of a complex system of interacting networks,
	involved in signal transduction, metabolism, and regulation. Regulatory
	networks can be thought of as the core brain, or master plan, controlling
	and operating all the functions of the cell. In this dissertation
	we try to gain better understanding of such networks by analyzing
	experimental data. Our approach is based on probabilistic generative
	modeling of experimental observations.\\\\
	
	 The challenge of learning about regulatory networks includes both
	unraveling their structure (a qualitative aspect) and the precise
	nature of local interactions in them (a quantitative aspect). Both
	these aspects are important for understanding how these networks
	work, what dynamic behaviour they display under different conditions
	and what is their expected response to specific stimuli. New experimental
	methods that have emerged in the past few years have made the exploration
	of such networks possible. These methods include parallel measurement
	of mRNA abundance, or alternatively regulator binding location, for
	many thousands of genes simultaneously. However, learning from such
	data sources poses several challenges. First, both the biological
	processes that generated the observed data and the processes involved
	in measuring those phenomena involve stochastic aspects, and are
	therefore not deterministic, nor exactly replicable. Second, most
	of the stages and quantities in the regulatory pathways are not observed,
	and many of the design details are not known. Finally, current data
	sets are sparse, while the number of participating genes in those
	networks can be very large. \\\\
	
	 The model-based approach we present tries to describe how such data
	sets were generated. To cope with the above challenges, it has to
	account for stochasticity at all levels, to allow the use of unobserved
	entities, and to be able to search for the "correct" design diagram.
	In the theoretical part of this work we present our choice of modeling
	language, which is based on probabilistic graphical models, as well
	as novel representation schemes, model assessment methods and search
	algorithms which are needed to adapt this language to our task, coping
	with its specific difficulties. We then present two approaches for
	using these tools to learn regulatory networks from data. \\\\
	
	 We first introduce a novel representation scheme for Bayesian networks
	based on Gaussian processes priors. These priors are semi-parametric
	in nature and can learn almost arbitrary noisy functional relations.
	We develop the Bayesian score of Gaussian Process Networks and describe
	how to learn them from data. We present empirical results on artificial
	and real-life domains with non-linear dependencies.\\\\
	
	 Next, we introduce two novel methods for learning the structure of
	Bayesian networks, which address specific difficulties: The first
	enables handling very large domains, and the second allows learning
	continuous variable networks with non-linear interactions as well
	as handling new hidden variables. The \emph{Sparse Candidate} algorithm
	achieves faster learning by restricting the search space. It iteratively
	restricts the parents of each variable to belong to a small subset
	of candidates, and then searches for a network that satisfies these
	constraints. We evaluate this algorithm both on synthetic and real-life
	data. Our results show that it is significantly faster than alternative
	search procedures without loss of quality in the learned structures.
	The \emph{Ideal Parent} method is a general method for significantly
	speeding the structure search for continuous variable networks with
	common parametric distributions. Importantly, this method facilitates
	the efficient addition of new hidden variables into the network structure.
	We demonstrate the method on several data sets, both for learning
	structure on fully observable data, and for introducing new hidden
	variables during structure search. \\\\
	
	 In the second part of the thesis we apply the tools from probabilistic
	modeling for the task of learning regulatory networks from gene expression
	data. We begin by introducing the first application of Bayesian networks
	for modeling gene regulatory networks. We show how such networks
	can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method
	for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using Bayesian
	network learning techniques, and demonstrate the method on real data
	from yeast.\\\\
	
	 Finally, we introduce a more realistic modeling approach. Unlike
	most previous works in the field, here we employ quantitative transcription
	rates, and simultaneously estimate both the kinetic parameters that
	govern these rates, and the activity levels of unobserved regulators
	that control them. We apply our approach to expression data sets
	from yeast and E. Coli and show that we can learn the unknown regulator
	activity profiles, as well as the binding affinity parameters. We
	also show how the "Ideal Parent" method enables us to improve initial
	guesses of regulation topology, as well as reconstruct ab initio
	the regulatory network from those data sets.},

  abstract = {Many computer vision tasks may be expressed as the problem of learning
	a mapping between image space and a parameter space. For example,
	in human body pose estimation, recent research has directly modelled
	the mapping from image features ($z$) to joint angles ($\theta$).
	Fitting such models requires training data in the form of labelled
	($z$,$\theta$) pairs, from which are learned the conditional densities
	$p(\theta | z)$. Inference is then simple: given test image features
	$z$, the conditional $p(\theta | z)$ is immediately computed. However
	large amounts of training data are required to fit the models, particularly
	in the case where the spaces are high dimensional.
	
	 We show how the use of unlabelled data-samples from the marginal
	distributions $p(z)$ and $p(\theta)$ may be used to improve fitting.
	This is valuable because it is often significantly easier to obtain
	unlabelled than labelled samples. We use a Gaussian process latent
	variable model to learn the mapping from a shared latent low-dimensional
	manifold to the feature and parameter spaces. This extends existing
	approaches to (a) use unlabelled data, and (b) represent one-to-many
	mappings.
	
	 Experiments on synthetic and real problems demonstrate how the use

	we include existing approaches that are explicitly semi-supervised

	intracellular fluorescence in T cells (CD3+) and monocytes (CD14+).

	To be specific, we develop Bayesian inference for the distribution
	and density functions of the model output. Modelling the output,
	as a function of its inputs, as a Gaussian process, we derive expressions
	for the posterior mean and variance of the distribution and density
	functions, based on data comprising observed outputs at a sample
	of input configurations. We show that direct computation of these
	expressions may encounter numerical difficulties. We develop an alternative
	approach based on simulating approximate realisations from the posterior
	distribution of the output function. Two examples are given to illustrate

	These are neglected in many other methods. We test the framework
	on toy benchmark problems for binary variables on fully connected
	graphs and 2D grids and compare with other methods, such as loopy
	belief propagation. Good performance is already achieved by using
	single nodes as tractable substructures. Significant improvements

	 RESULTS: We have used this data set in a comparison of methods which
	is far more extensive than any previous study. We outline six stages
	in the analysis pipeline where decisions need to be made, and show
	how the results of these decisions can lead to the apparently contradictory
	results previously found. We also show that, while flawed, this data
	set is still a useful tool for method comparison, particularly for
	identifying combinations of summarization and differential expression
	methods that are unlikely to perform well on real data sets. We describe
	a new benchmark, AffyDEComp, that can be used for such a comparison.
	\\\\
	
	 CONCLUSION: We conclude with recommendations for preferred Affymetrix
	analysis tools, and for the development of future spike-in data sets.},

	method is orders of magnitude faster than current fitting methods

	thresholds for transcription factors. Our technique also allows us
	to infer regulatory relationships de novo or to test network structures
	suggested by the literature. We fit a series of models to test several
	outstanding questions about gap gene regulation, including regulation
	of and by hunchback and the role of autoactivation. Based on our
	modeling results and validation against the experimental literature,
	we propose a revised network structure for the gap gene system. Interestingly,

	to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number
	of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from
	the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet
	processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering property
	of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number
	of mixture componentswithin each group. Given our desire to tie the

	model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet
	processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process.
	Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes
	necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in
	the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss
	representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a
	stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant
	process that we refer to as the âChinese restaurant franchise.â We

  abstract = {To determine whether the plasma levels of a range of inflammatory
	proteins have utility as biomarkers of disease activity in rheumatoid
	arthritis (RA) patients.Plasma proteins (n = 163) were profiled in
	44 patients with RA diagnosed according to the American College of
	Rheumatology 1987 criteria (22 with active and 22 with quiescent
	disease) and in 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The utility
	of a subset of differentially expressed proteins as predictors of
	RA disease activity was investigated using partial least-squares
	discriminant analysis, and their response to therapeutic intervention
	was evaluated in plasma from an additional cohort of 16 patients
	with active RA treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha).The
	protein profiling study identified 25 proteins that were differentially
	expressed in plasma samples from patients with active RA (P for the
	false discovery rate < or = 0.01) compared with those with quiescent
	RA, including the previously described interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin
	M, and IL-2, and the 5 less-established markers macrophage colony-stimulating
	factor (M-CSF), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member
	9, CCL23, transforming growth factor alpha, and CXCL13. Systemic
	levels of these 5 markers correlated with the C-reactive protein
	level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor level, tender
	joint count in 68 joints, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints
	(DAS28), and their combined plasma levels were shown to be good predictors
	of disease activity (kappa = 0.64). In anti-TNFalpha-treated RA patients,
	plasma levels of CXCL13 were reduced after 1 and 7 days of therapy,
	and levels of CCL23, M-CSF, and CXCL13 showed a statistically significant
	positive correlation with the DAS28 score.This exploratory study
	for biomarker discovery led to the identification of several proteins
	predictive of RA disease activity that may be useful in the definition
	of disease subphenotypes and in the measurement of response to therapy
	in clinical studies.},

  number = {6},
  abstract = {{\bf Motivation:} Genetic networks are often described statistically
	using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However, inferring
	the network structure offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis
	where the sample size is small compared to the number of considered
	genes. This renders many standard algorithms for graphical models
	inapplicable, and inferring genetic networks an 'ill-posed' inverse
	problem.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Methods:} We introduce a novel framework for small-sample inference
	of graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically, we focus
	on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are now frequently
	used to describe gene association networks and to detect conditionally
	dependent genes. Our new approach is based on (1) improved (regularized)
	small-sample point estimates of partial correlation, (2) an exact
	test of edge inclusion with adaptive estimation of the degree of
	freedom and (3) a heuristic network search based on false discovery
	rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond to an empirical
	Bayes estimate of the network topology.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Results:} Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity
	(power) and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed framework
	to estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that it is possible
	to recover the true network topology with high accuracy even for
	small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data
	from a breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach by inferring
	a corresponding large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.\\\\

	in some singular domains in two dimensions. The mean escape time
	comes up in many applications, because it represents the mean time

	Error Bounds and Sparse Approximations},
  school = {The University of Edinburgh},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Non-parametric models and techniques enjoy a growing popularity in
	the field of machine learning, and among these Bayesian inference
	for Gaussian process (GP) models has recently received significant
	attention. We feel that GP priors should be part of the standard
	toolbox for constructing models relevant to machine learning in the
	same way as parametric linear models are, and the results in this
	thesis help to remove some obstacles on the way towards this goal.
	
	
	 In the first main chapter, we provide a distribution-free finite
	sample bound on the difference between generalisation and empirical
	(training) error for GP classification methods. While the general
	theorem (the PAC-Bayesian bound) is not new, we give a much simplified
	and somewhat generalised derivation and point out the underlying
	core technique (convex duality) explicitly. Furthermore, the application
	to GP models is novel (to our knowledge). A central feature of this
	bound is that its quality depends crucially on task knowledge being
	encoded faithfully in the model and prior distributions, so there
	is a mutual benet between a sharp theoretical guarantee and empirically
	well-established statistical practices. Extensive simulations on
	real-world classification tasks indicate an impressive tightness
	of the bound, in spite of the fact that many previous bounds for
	related kernel machines fail to give non-trivial guarantees in this
	practically relevant regime.
	
	 In the second main chapter, sparse approximations are developed to
	address the problem of the unfavourable scaling of most GP techniques
	with large training sets. Due to its high importance in practice,
	this problem has received a lot of attention recently. We demonstrate
	the tractability and usefulness of simple greedy forward selection
	with information-theoretic criteria previously used in active learning
	(or sequential design) and develop generic schemes for automatic
	model selection with many (hyper)parameters. We suggest two new generic
	schemes and evaluate some of their variants on large real-world classfication
	and regression tasks. These schemes and their underlying principles
	(which are clearly stated and analysed) can be applied to obtain
	sparse approximations for a wide regime of GP models far beyond the
	special cases we studied here.},

	randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically

	function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal
	expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external
	signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable

	agent performs a regression from the latent variable space to a high
	dimensional space representing degrees of freedom of its motor system.

	capture data from human actors to a humanoid robot. We also contrast
	use of several low-dimensional latent variable spaces, each covering
	a subset of agentsâ degrees of freedom, with use of a single, higher-dimensional
	latent variable space. Our findings suggest that compositing several
	regression models together yields qualitatively better imitation
	results than using a single, more complex regression model.},

	 Microarray experiments are generating datasets that can help in reconstructing
	gene networks. One of the most important problems in network reconstruction
	is finding, for each gene in the network, which genes can affect

	 {\bf Results}\\\\
	
	 We present algorithms that work for continuous expression levels
	and do not require a priori discretization. We apply our method to
	publicly available data for the budding yeast cell cycle. The obtained
	classifiers can be presented as simple rules defining gene interrelations.
	In most cases the extracted rules confirm the existing knowledge
	about cell-cycle gene expression, while hitherto unknown relationships
	can be treated as new hypotheses.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Conclusions}\\\\
	
	 All the relations between the considered genes are consistent with
	the facts reported in the literature. This indicates that the approach
	presented here is valid and that the resulting rules can be used
	as elements for building and explaining gene networks.},

	and 20,169 controls of European descent, followed by replication
	in an independent set of 6,768 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 8,806

	risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x
	10(-8)) in an analysis of all 41,282 samples. The associated SNPs
	are near genes of known immune function, including IL6ST, SPRED2,
	RBPJ, CCR6, IRF5 and PXK. We also refined associations at two established
	rheumatoid arthritis risk loci (IL2RA and CCL21) and confirmed the
	association at AFF3. These new associations bring the total number
	of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals
	of European ancestry. An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05,
	many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that
	most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles.},

	in the sequence of regulatory regions. To understand the effect of
	a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important
	to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here,
	we present VBQTL, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression
	quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that jointly models contributions
	from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. VBQTL
	is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework,
	making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare
	the performance of VBQTL with alternative methods for dealing with
	confounding variability on eQTL mapping datasets from simulations,
	yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and
	joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the
	contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional
	associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative
	approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis eQTLs
	than previously found in a whole-genome eQTL scan of an outbred human
	population. Altogether, 27\% of the tested probes show a significant
	genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional eQTLs
	are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals.
	Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype
	data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation
	of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting eQTLs
	in human than previously shown. Our software is freely available

	at the Dntt promoter by the ordered deacetylation of histone H3 at
	Lys9 (H3-Lys9), loss of methylation at H3-Lys4 and acquisition of
	methylation at H3-Lys9, followed by bidirectional spreading of each
	event. Deacetylation at H3-Lys9 coincided with pericentromeric repositioning,
	and neither of these early events required de novo protein synthesis.
	CpG methylation increased primarily in mature T cells that had left
	the thymus. A transformed thymocyte line supported reversible inactivation
	of Dntt without repositioning. In these cells, histone modification
	changes were nucleated at the promoter but did not spread. These
	results provide a foundation for elucidating the mechanisms of silent

	at the protein level in one dimension. The data used for this characterization
	are quantitative with cellular resolution in space and about 6 min
	in time. We present the full quantitative profiles of all 14 segmentation
	genes which act before the onset of gastrulation. The expression
	patterns of these genes are first characterized in terms of their
	average or typical behavior. At this level, the expression of all
	of the genes has been integrated into a single atlas of gene expression
	in which the expression levels of all genes in each cell are specified.
	We show that expression domains do not arise synchronously, but rather
	each domain has its own specific dynamics of formation. Moreover,
	we show that the expression domains shift position in the direction
	of the cephalic furrow, such that domains in the anlage of the segmented
	germ band shift anteriorly while those in the presumptive head shift
	posteriorly. The expression atlas of integrated data is very close
	to the expression profiles of individual embryos during the latter
	part of the blastoderm stage. At earlier times gap gene domains show
	considerable variation in amplitude, and significant positional variability.
	Nevertheless, an average early gap domain is close to that of a median
	individual. In contrast, we show that there is a diversity of developmental
	trajectories among pair-rule genes at a variety of levels, including
	the order of domain formation and positional accuracy. We further
	show that this variation is dynamically reduced, or canalized, over
	time. As the first quantitatively characterized morphogenetic field,
	this system and its behavior constitute an extraordinarily rich set
	of materials for the study of canalization and embryonic regulation

	from a single image. Given a differentiable function that maps from
	pose space to image feature space, the goal is to invert the process:
	estimate the pose given only image features. The inversion is an
	ill-posed problem as the inverse mapping is a one to many process,
	hence multiple solutions exist. It is desirable to restrict the solution
	space to a smaller subset of feasible solutions. The space of feasible
	solutions may not admit a closed form description. The proposed framework
	seeks to learn an approximation over such a space. Using Gaussian
	Process Latent Variable Modelling. The scaled conjugate gradient
	method is used to find the best matching pose in the learned space.
	The formulation allows easy incorporation of various constraints
	for more accurate pose estimation. The performance of the proposed
	approach is evaluated in the task of upper-body pose estimation from
	silhouettes and compared with the Specialized Mapping Architecture.
	The proposed approach performs better than the latter approach in
	terms of estimation accuracy with synthetic data and qualitatively
	better results with real video of humans performing gestures.},

  abstract = {It has been argued that a single two-dimensional visualization plot
	may not be sufficient to capture all of the interesting aspects of
	complex data sets and, therefore, a hierarchical visualization system
	is desirable. In this paper we extend an existing locally linear
	hierarchical visualization system PhiVis \cite{Bishop:hierarchy98}
	in several directions: 1) We allow for \emph{nonlinear} proection
	manifolds. The basic building block is the Generative Topographic
	Mapping (GTM). 2) We introduce a general formulation of hierarchical
	probabilistic models consisting of local probabilistic models organized
	in a hierarchical tree. General training equations are derived, regardless
	of the position of the model in the tree. 3) Using tools from differential
	geometry, we derive expressions for local directional curvatures
	of the projection manifold. Like PhiVis, our system is statistically
	principled and is built interactively in a top down fashioon using
	the EM algorithm. It enables the user to iteractively highlight those
	data in the ancestor visualization plots which are captured by a
	child model. We also incoporate into our system a hierarchical, locally
	selective representation of magnification factors and directional
	curvatures of the projection manifolds. Such information is important
	for further refinement of the hierarchical visualisation plot, as
	well as for controlling the amount of regularization imposed on the
	local models. We demonstrate the principle of the approach on a toy
	data set and apply our system to two more complex 12 and 18-dimensional
	data sets.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular techniques
	for processing, compressing and visualising data, although its effectiveness

	have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity

	PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is
	no unique way to combine PCA models. Previous attempts to formulate
	mixture models for PCA have therefore to some extent been ad hoc.
	In this paper, PCA is formulated within a maximum-likelihood framework,
	based on a specific form of Gaussian latent variable model. This
	leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal
	component analysers, whose parameters can be determined using an

	 RESULTS: As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression
	patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, we examined 2,179 genes
	by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes
	assayed, 63.7\% displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented
	with 25,690 digital photomicrographs of individual embryos. The photomicrographs
	were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures
	that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated
	a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using
	microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ
	hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data
	are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA
	transcripts of about 1\% of genes show clear subcellular localization.
	Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present
	an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of
	annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar
	sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns.
	CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization
	to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can
	be used to identify genes involved in developmental processes that
	have been missed by traditional genetic analysis. Systematic analysis
	of rigorously annotated patterns of gene expression will complement
	and extend the types of analyses carried out using expression microarrays.},

	over another. Marginal likelihood is a key component of Bayes factors,
	however computing the marginal likelihood is a difficult problem,
	as it involves integration of nonlinear functions in multidimensional
	space. There are a number of methods available to compute the marginal
	likelihood approximately. A detailed investigation of such methods
	is required to find ones that perform appropriately for biochemical
	modelling.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Results}: We assess four methods for estimation of the marginal
	likelihoods required for computing Bayes factors. The Prior Arithmetic
	Mean estimator, the Posterior Harmonic Mean estimator, the Annealed
	Importance Sampling and the Annealing-Melting Integration methods
	are investigated and compared on a typical case study in Systems
	Biology. This allows us to understand the stability of the analysis
	results and make reliable judgements in uncertain context. We investigate
	the variance of Bayes factor estimates, and highlight the stability
	of the Annealed Importance Sampling and the Annealing- Melting Integration
	methods for the purposes of comparing nonlinear models.\\\\
	
	 {\bf Availability}: Models used in this study are available in SBML
	format as the supplementary material to this paper.\\\\

  abstract = {Eukaryotic mRNAs contain 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) that are involved
	in posttranscriptional control of gene expression. AU-rich octanucleotide
	repeats, UUAUUUAU, present in the 3'-UTR of mature lymphokine and
	other cytokine transcripts, have been implicated in the regulation
	of mRNA stability and translational efficiency. For example, previous
	evidence suggests that the AU-rich element (ARE) present in the 3'-UTR
	of murine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can affect the
	posttranscriptional regulation of murine TNF-alpha gene expression
	in hematopoietic cells. Although cytokines are produced in epithelial
	cells, little is known about the regulation of TNF-alpha and other
	cytokine gene expression by 3'-UTR elements in human malignant epithelial
	cells. To better understand the function of the 3'-UTR of the human
	TNF-alpha gene in the regulation of TNF-alpha protein production
	in human epithelial cancer cells, a series of luciferase reporter
	constructs with portions of the 3'-UTR of human TNF-alpha was transfected
	into human breast carcinoma cell lines ZR-75-1 and ZR-75-1R (which
	overexpresses TNF-alpha). The 3'-UTR of TNF-alpha markedly suppressed
	luciferase activity in both cell lines, and the suppression of activity
	was reversed by deletion of the AU-rich sequences. This suppression
	was quantitative, with six repeats causing more inhibition than two
	repeats. Increased levels of luciferase activity were observed 3
	h after TNF-alpha stimulation in ZR-75-1 cells transfected by constructs
	containing AU-rich repeats. In addition, cytoplasmic extracts from
	both cell lines were assayed for factors that bind to the 3'-UTR
	of human TNF-alpha mRNA. RNA-protein binding activities were found
	in both cell lines. Competition studies showed that these proteins
	specifically bound to AU-rich repeats present in the 3'-UTR of TNF-alpha.
	No binding activity was observed when the AU-rich repeats were deleted.
	TNF-alpha exposure markedly increased activity of several RNA-binding
	proteins, especially a novel Mr 50,000-55,000 RNA-binding protein.
	The binding activity in untreated ZR-75-1R was higher than that in
	untreated ZR-75-1 cells, suggesting that the level of RNA-protein
	binding correlates with the expression level of TNF-alpha in human
	epithelial cancer cells and that the RNA-binding proteins may control
	expression of TNF-alpha in ZR-75-1 cells. We conclude that the AU-rich
	repeats in the 3'-UTR of human TNF-alpha mRNA may regulate gene expression
	in human epithelial cancer cells by binding to AU sequence-specific
	proteins, including a previously undescribed Mr 50,000-55,000 protein
	not observed in hematopoietic cells.},

	system such as the existence of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions,
	the directionality of signal transduction in protein-protein interactions,
	as well as signs of the immediate effects of these interactions.
	Possible configures of these variables are constrained by the available
	data sources. Some of the data sources such as factor-binding data
	involve measurements that are directly tied to the variables in the
	model. Other sources such as gene knock-outs are \emph{functional}
	in nature and provide only indirect evidence about the variables.
	We associated each observed knock-out effect in the deletion mutant
	data with a set of causal paths (molecular cascades) that could in
	principle explain the effect, resulting in aggregate constraints
	about the physical variables in the model. The most likely settings
	of all the variables, specifying the most likely graph annotations,
	are found by a recursive application of the max-product algorithm.
	By testing our approach on datasets related to the pheromone response
	pathway in \emph{S. cerevisiae}, we demonstrate that the resulting
	model is consistent with previous studies about the pathway. Moreover,
	we successfully predict gene knock-out effects with high degree of
	accuracy in a cross-validation setting. When applying this approach
	to genome-wide, we extract submodels consistent with previous studies.
	The apporach can be readily extended to other data sources, or to

  abstract = {As genome-scale measurements lead to increasingly complex models of
	gene regulation, systematic approaches are needed to validate and
	refine these models. Towards this goal, we describe an automated
	procedure for prioritizing genetic pertubations in order to discriminate
	optimally between alternative models of a gene-regulatory network.
	Using this procedure, we evaluate 38 candidate regulatory networks
	in yeast and perform four high-priority gene knockout experiments.
	The refined networks support previously unknown regulatory mechanisms
	downstream of \emph{SOK2} and \emph{SWI14}.}

	expression, which are primarily controlled by transcription factors
	binding to cis-regulatory modules. Although transcription factor
	occupancy can now be identified at genome-wide scales, decoding this
	regulatory landscape remains a daunting challenge. Here we used a
	novel approach to predict spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity
	based only on in vivo transcription factor binding and enhancer activity
	data. We generated a high-resolution atlas of cis-regulatory modules
	describing their temporal and combinatorial occupancy during Drosophila
	mesoderm development. The binding profiles of cis-regulatory modules
	with characterized expression were used to train support vector machines
	to predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns. In vivo transgenic
	reporter assays demonstrate the high accuracy of these predictions
	and reveal an unanticipated plasticity in transcription factor binding
	leading to similar expression. This data-driven approach does not
	require previous knowledge of transcription factor sequence affinity,
	function or expression, making it widely applicable.},
