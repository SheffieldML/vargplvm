  abstract = {Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a principled, practical, probabilistic
	approach to learning in kernel machines. GPs have received increased
	attention in the machine-learning community over the past decase,
	and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment
	of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning.
	The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targetd at researchers
	and students in machine learning and applied statistics.\\\\
	
	 The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression
	and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety
	of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties
	discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and
	a classical perspective. Many connections to other well known techniques
	from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector
	machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance
	vector machines, and others. Theoretical issues including learning
	curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation
	methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book
	contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets
	are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background
	and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

                 that occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and
                 outputs differs between training and test
                 stages. Covariate shift, a particular case of dataset
                 shift, occurs when only the input distribution
                 changes. Dataset shift is present in most practical
                 applications, for reasons ranging from the bias
                 introduced by experimental design to the
                 irreproducibility of the testing conditions at
                 training time. (An example is -email spam filtering,
                 which may fail to recognize spam that differs in form
                 from the spam the automatic filter has been built
                 on.) Despite this, and despite the attention given to
                 the apparently similar problems of semi-supervised
                 learning and active learning, dataset shift has
                 received relatively little attention in the machine
                 learning community until recently. This volume offers
                 an overview of current efforts to deal with dataset
                 and covariate shift.\\\\

                The chapters offer a mathematical and philosophical
                introduction to the problem, place dataset shift in
                relationship to transfer learning, transduction, local
                learning, active learning, and semi-supervised
                learning, provide theoretical views of dataset and
                covariate shift (including decision theoretic and
                Bayesian perspectives), and present algorithms for
                covariate shift.},

  abstract =	 {Computational systems biology aims to develop algorithms 
                 that uncover the structure and parameterization of
                 the underlying mechanistic model—in other words, to
                 answer specific questions about the underlying
                 mechanisms of a biological system—in a process that
                 can be thought of as learning or inference. This
                 volume offers state-of-the-art perspectives from
                 computational biology, statistics, modeling, and
                 machine learning on new methodologies for learning
                 and inference in biological networks.

                 The chapters offer practical approaches to biological
                 inference problems ranging from genome-wide inference
                 of genetic regulation to pathway-specific
                 studies. Both deterministic models (based on ordinary
                 differential equations) and stochastic models (which
                 anticipate the increasing availability of data from
                 small populations of cells) are considered. Several
                 chapters emphasize Bayesian inference, so the editors
                 have included an introduction to the philosophy of
                 the Bayesian approach and an overview of current work
                 on Bayesian inference. Taken together, the methods
                 discussed by the experts in Learning and Inference in
                 Computational Systems Biology provide a foundation
                 upon which the next decade of research in systems
                 biology can be built.}
